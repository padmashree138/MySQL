I learnt About :

1. SELECT statment : used for selecting the files.
2. WHERE statment : used for getting the data according to condition that we have given
3. Operators such as
    1) AND : used for more then one condition
   2) OR : used to add multiple condition
   3) NOT : used for not executing the condition
       ![AND, OR , NOT](https://github.com/padmashree138/MySQL/assets/156641444/021f63a1-8239-46da-9f61-5e5070a038e9)
4. IN operator : used to get the data from the perticular value
   ![IN operator](https://github.com/padmashree138/MySQL/assets/156641444/c99db503-71c3-4576-a687-06a963810355)

5. BETWEEN OPERATOR : used to get data in ranges
   ![Between Operator](https://github.com/padmashree138/MySQL/assets/156641444/127e27f4-e084-4f63-a94d-6f223a4fa0c1)
   
6. LIKE OPERATOR : used to get data which is in similar pattern
   ![Like Operator](https://github.com/padmashree138/MySQL/assets/156641444/fd0d6be2-85f2-4f69-a541-7767d5eab9e1)

7. REGEXP regular expression : used for searching data
   ![Regular Expression](https://github.com/padmashree138/MySQL/assets/156641444/bc3fe2b8-08e0-4409-90aa-6cf85b887daf)

8. IS NULL Operator : used for searching the null value

9. Order By Operator : used for changing the order of data and DESC to print data in desending order
10. Limit Operator : used to get data in ranges
11. Inner Join : used to combine columns
    ![Inner Joins](https://github.com/padmashree138/MySQL/assets/156641444/16ff0423-3c4f-4cd6-8ea6-aca5c07fa7de)

12. Joining across the Table : used to join one database to another and get the table
13. Self Join : similar to joing acros the table but used to join diffrent alises
    ![Self Joins](https://github.com/padmashree138/MySQL/assets/156641444/6594ab22-07b9-4d70-8f6b-77cd6c2644ca)

14. Join multiple table : to join multiple tables
    ![Joining Multiple Tables](https://github.com/padmashree138/MySQL/assets/156641444/7fb3652a-6eb9-4a40-bef9-a1fa76b047a8)

15. Compound Join Conditions : used to uniquely identify the column when there are simmilar id's in the column
16. Outer Joins : used to combine rows from another table (can be done from right or left)
     1) The code contains : 
     * outer joins
     * outer join with multiple tables,
     *  self outer joins
    ![Outer Joins](https://github.com/padmashree138/MySQL/assets/156641444/be8031dc-05a6-44cf-ac8b-2771c3a2ecc6)

18. Outer Joins Between Multiple Tables : used to get data from multiple table at a time
19. Using Clause : used instead of ON clause
    ![Using Clause](https://github.com/padmashree138/MySQL/assets/156641444/18b8cdfd-5dfe-42e6-90a6-8161e86a02ee)

20. Natural Joins : joins the table based on the common column
21. Cross Joins : used to combine data in database
22. Union :  used for combining rows form the table
    ![Unions](https://github.com/padmashree138/MySQL/assets/156641444/947c03e4-b6a0-4ad1-894f-47ed9ec9ad67)

23. Inserting single and multiple rows
24. Inserting hierarchical rows
25. Creating copy of table
26. Updating and deleting rows
27. Restoring database
